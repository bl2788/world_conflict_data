["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The dataset has a .RData version, which we can directly load using R, therefore, we do not have to worry much about reading the data into R. However, we would like to change the data class of several columns to fit our study better. In the original data, all columns with fully numeric values will be considered as “numeric.” For example, the column year would be considered as numeric, and we don’t need to transform it further. However, the type_of_violence column will also be considered as numeric, in which it should be categorical. Therefore, we change the 1, 2, and 3 values in type_of_violence to categories – “state-based conflict”, “non-state conflict”, and &quot; one-sided violence.&quot; Further, we would like to change the date_start and date_end to the DateTime class. The dataset we chose is very larger, to save the space, we would like to reduce the dataset only with columns we are might be interested in. The following are the variables and their explanations. Explanations are referred from the codebook of the dataset [source]. Variable Explanation id An unique ID identifying a conflict event date_start The earliest possible date when the conflict event has taken place date_end The last possible date when the conflict event has taken place year The year of the conflict event active_year 1: belongs to an active conflict type_of_violence 1: state-based conflict (involved with a government of a state or any opposition organization or alliance of organizations); 2: non-state conflict (between organized armed groups); 3: one-sided violence (against civilians) side_a/side_b The name of the two sides longitude/latitude Best estimated or the actual location of the conflict event takes place country Name of the country of the conflict event takes place region Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, Middle East death_* Best estimate of fatalities for the specific group best Best estimate of fatalities resulting from the conflict event high/low The highest/lowest estimation of the total fatalities But in some instances, we may want to use the original dataset. The transformed dataset is stored in “data/clean/df_process.RData”. In our study, we find the most extreme values of this dataset are related to the Rwanda genocide in 1994, which we will have detailed explanations in the following sections. Sometimes, we need to include these records in our analysis, and sometimes we don’t. Therefore, we decide to have a data frame to record the unique conflict event ID of records related to the Rwanda genocide. Then we can quickly include and filter our these records in our future coding. The data frame is stored as “data/clean/df_rwa.RData”. For other transformations made for analysis and visualization, please refer to our code on GitHub repo. In our project, we would also like to investigate the geographic or spatial pattern of the data. We use the world map data from ggplot’s map_data. However, some countries’ names in the world are different from what we have in the dataset. We want to modify the country name of world map data to make them identical with the name in our dataset. The following countries have different names. The modified world data file is stored as “data/clean/WorldData.RData”. in_ggplot_map in_dataset Democratic Republic of the Congo DR Congo (Zaire) Republic of Congo Congo Russia Russia (Soviet Union) Yemen Yemen (North Yemen) Myanmar Myanmar (Burma) Cambodia Cambodia (Kampuchea) UK United Kingdom Zimbabwe Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) Bosnia and Herzegovina Bosnia-Herzegovina Serbia Serbia (Yugoslavia) Macedonia Macedonia, FYR Swaziland Kingdom of eSwatini (Swaziland) Romania Rumania Trinidad Trinidad and Tobago Tobago Trinidad and Tobago USA United States of America Madagascar Madagascar (Malagasy) "],
["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values There are 152616 rows in the dataset, and the following outputs are the number of rows missing for the specific variable. We do not need to know the detailed explanations of each variable at the current stage, the descriptions of certain variables are included in the previous Section III. For the full explanations of each variable, please refer to the codebook. ## gwnob gwnoa year side_b ## 151812 35321 0 0 ## active_year side_a priogrid_gid conflict_new_id ## 0 0 0 0 ## country_id region source_article type_of_violence ## 0 0 0 0 ## date_prec source_headline conflict_name dyad_name ## 0 0 0 0 ## event_clarity where_coordinates date_end side_b_new_id ## 0 0 0 0 ## dyad_new_id high source_office deaths_civilians ## 0 0 0 0 ## best number_of_sources source_date longitude ## 0 0 0 0 ## where_prec side_a_new_id id source_original ## 0 0 0 0 ## adm_1 country adm_2 latitude ## 0 0 0 0 ## geom_wkt date_start deaths_a deaths_b ## 0 0 0 0 ## deaths_unknown low geometry ## 0 0 0 There are only 2 variables that contains a lot of missing variables, gwnob and gwnoa. gwnoa is The Gleditsch and Ward number for Side A if the side is a state. If side A is not a state, then gwnoa will be missing. Similarly, gwnob is The Gleditsch and Ward number for Side B. It will be missing if side B is not a state. The reason why gwnob has more missing values is that in one-sided violence, side B will be recorded as “civilians” in this dataset, which is definitely not a state. Meanwhile, there are 152616 rows in the dataset. The number of missing values in gwnob column is 151812. gwnob of most rows are missing. However, for row patterns, we already know that, in each row, if side A is not a state, gwnoa will be missing and if side B is not a state, gwnob will be missing. From the graph, we can see that most rows has at least one missing value, which correspondes to our analysis for column patterns that gwnob of most rows are missing. As mentioned in Section III “Data transformation,” we are most interested in certain sets of variables, gwnoa and gwnob are not considered as “very important” in our project. Therefore, we would not worried much about missing gwnoa and gwnob values in the dataset. There are no missing values for the variables we are most interested in, which are described in Section III “Data transformation.” "],
["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution of the number of deaths based on conflict 5.2 Relation between conflict and time 5.3 Patterns between geographical location and type of violence", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution of the number of deaths based on conflict As shown in the top-left plot, the dataset is highly skewed and imbalanced. When we focus on the data with death less than 100 people, we can see the data are more concentrated in &lt;20 regions. Most conflict events have less than five deaths. The above Cleveland plot shows top conflict events which caused most deaths (\\(\\geq\\) 5,000), there is a conflict event happened in Rwanda caused approximately 300,000 deaths, which is much more than other conflicts event. Also, most of those events causing significant fatalities were taken place in Rwanda. id side_a side_b year best 13767 45108 Government of Rwanda Civilians 1994 300557 47072 34362 Government of Eritrea Government of Ethiopia 2000 48183 35731 40030 Government of Rwanda Civilians 1994 40000 21448 34346 Government of Eritrea Government of Ethiopia 1999 30000 35679 39595 Government of Rwanda Civilians 1994 27500 14095 142243 Government of Rwanda Civilians 1994 20000 35647 39465 Government of Rwanda Civilians 1994 16890 20705 34345 Government of Eritrea Government of Ethiopia 1999 15000 1943 33614 Government of Rwanda Civilians 1994 12000 35674 143468 Government of Rwanda Civilians 1994 11170 After an investigation of those conflict events, we found out most of them are between the Government of Rewanda and civilians, which was related to the Rwanda genocide in 1994. 5.2 Relation between conflict and time As shown in the bar chart, the number of conflict events that occur in each year tends to increase from 1998 to 2018. The number of conflicts is lowest in 1997. The conflict-caused deaths are extremely high in 1994, as shown in the left plot. As mentioned in the previous point, a high number of deaths were probably related to the Rwanda genocide. When we filter out the data related to the Rwanda genocide, we get the plot on the right. The conflict-caused death per year decreased from 1989 until 2005, after 2005, the number tends to increase. Most conflict events are state-based conflict, i.e., the conflict involved with “[a] government of a state or any opposition organization or alliance of organizations” [source, pp.28-29], which is higher in number comparing to the other two types of conflict. Before 2018, there are more one-side conflicts (against civilians) than non-state conflicts (between two armed groups). But in 2018, there are more non-state conflicts compare to one-side conflict. If you are interested in the detailed and formal definition of these three types of conflict, please refer to this source, pp. 28-31. We want to check further how many civilians deaths each year, compare to the deaths of non-civilians caused by conflicts. id side_a side_b year deaths_civilians country 1121 24675 AFDL Civilians 1996 3200 DR Congo (Zaire) 971 24212 AFDL Civilians 1996 1589 DR Congo (Zaire) 26 24564 AFDL Civilians 1996 1500 DR Congo (Zaire) 2750 20214 AFDL Civilians 1996 1500 DR Congo (Zaire) 24 24575 AFDL Civilians 1996 1256 DR Congo (Zaire) 988 24366 AFDL Civilians 1996 1000 DR Congo (Zaire) 1095 45053 ULIMO - J Civilians 1996 1000 Liberia 893 24626 AFDL Civilians 1996 887 DR Congo (Zaire) 881 23936 AFDL Civilians 1996 851 DR Congo (Zaire) 908 24489 AFDL Civilians 1996 830 DR Congo (Zaire) From the above plots, the top-left one, we can see that there are large civilians death in conflicts happened in 1994, which potentially because of the Rwanda genocide; after removing the records regarding the Rwanda genocide, the civilian deaths in 1994 was similar with other years. The bottom two plots show the proportion of civilian deaths caused by conflicts, by comparing the left and right plots, we can see that the Rwanda genocide is the reason of leading extreme high proportion of civilian deaths. In most of the years, the percentage of civilian deaths is around 25%, except in the year 1994 and the year 1996. After further checking, the reason for the high proportion of civilian deaths in 1996 is probably due to the First Congo War. 5.3 Patterns between geographical location and type of violence Fristly, we want to briefly see the pattern between region and type of violence. After anaysis of relation between region and type of violence, we want to We also plot "],
